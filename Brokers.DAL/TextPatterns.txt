A rich uniform, half French, half Oriental
Above this floor was a large atelier
And he stepped on one side
At the end of a long corridor
Cooks, and Charles Leboucher
However, the morning of the appointment
Lucca della Robbia faïences, and Palissy platters
On the floor above were similar rooms
Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows
The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber
The rest of the furniture
The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan
The young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness
There were collected
There, on a table, surrounded at some
a boudoir, and a bedroom
according to their size and quality
adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
and black moustache
and hid from the garden and court these two apartments
and his broad chest was decorated
and it was here that he received Grisier
and of narghiles, with their long tubes of morocco
and piled up all Albert’s successive caprices
and single-sticks—for
and so on along the scale
and which formed the antechamber
and, in an open cabinet, a collection of German pipes
as they were on the ground floor
awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers
by an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident
by pulling down the partitions—a pandemonium
distance by a large and luxurious divan
easels, palettes, brushes
every species of tobacco known
evidently came from the Louvre
filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases
foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords
following the example of the fashionable
for Albert had had not a taste but a fancy for music
for the use of smokers
formed out of the antechamber
from Maryland and Porto Rico
from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg
hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes—a whole orchestra
i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick
in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged
in the small salon downstairs
in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence
looking into the court, and on the left the salon
looking into the garden
of chibouques, with their amber mouth-pieces ornamented with coral
of crackled earthenware of which
of old armchairs, in which perhaps had sat Henry IV
of refined and dignified bearing
of this privileged apartment consisted of old cabinets
or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieu—for two of these armchairs
or, at least
pencils—for music had been succeeded by painting
piercing eyes
puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas
set off his graceful and stalwart figure
some royal residence
that every precaution had been taken
the Dutch are so fond; beside them
the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field
the only rooms into which
the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
the three arts that complete a dandy’s education
the young man had established himself
these three rooms were a salon
to Latakia,—was exposed in pots
to give place to a young man
to the black of Sinai
under circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten
was, on the right, Albert’s breakfast-room
which had been increased in size
whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles
with far more perseverance than music and drawing
with large and open brow
with the addition of a third
with the order of the Legion of Honor
with which the door communicated
young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated
